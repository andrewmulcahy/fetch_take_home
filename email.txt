Subject Line: Data Quality Issues and Insights from Investigation on Transactions

Hello [Leader],

I just wanted to follow up regarding the investigation on the Transacations data we were discussing.

During my investigation, I encountered some data quality issues as well as some areas where I could use some support.

Below are some quality issues I ran into:

Users Table:
1) There are null values in key columns
2) The state field has invalid entries (ex: PR)
3) There are overlapping categories in gender, which I needed to clean

Transactions Table:
1) Missing barcode values prevented joining to our Product data
2) The columns FINAL_QUANITIY and FINAL_SALE contained irrelevant data as well as incorrect data types

Products Table:
1) Missing barcode values prevented joining to our Transaction data
2) Duplicate rows were present

Joined Tables:
1) After joining our Users and Products, I encountered many null values creating significant gaps in our data, making it nearly unusable


After reviewing these tables, I could use your support with the following:
1) Escalating to Engineering leadership
	a) I will reach out to our Engineering partners to see if this data is available, but I may need your help escalating if I do not hear back
2) We need to align on a better standard of work, to make sure our data is being captured correctly, so we don't encounter this in the future
3) We need stricter requirements with our data to ensure all necessary data is being captured


On a more positive note, I did uncover an interesting trend in our data - Tositios is the leading the category Dips & Salsa in both receipts and sales, so it appears they are a top brand. 
Again, this is assuming our data is correct, but I will be able to confirm that after we recover some of the missing data from Engineering.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you need more details from me!

Thank you,
Andrew Mulcahy
